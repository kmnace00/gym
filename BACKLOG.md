# BACKLOG — ranked improvement ideas

## Batch 6 — ACTIVE Nov 10 (Muse), approved by Khang (one-tap); DECISIONS LANDED Nov 10

B6-01 (`Stats.parseKey` round-trip) is BUILT + VERIFIED. The decision-gated items are decided: on Nov 10 Khang delegated them ("Do the gym improvement list, do whatever you think is best") and Muse decided all of them — P9 ATTRIBUTE (fix week-strip/heatmap visibility), `bodyweightSet` flag ADOPTED (schema v5), P6 2-for-2 ADOPTED, P8 APPROVED, P11 alternate list APPROVED for all 24 lifts (log under the original id with a swap marker, progression-exempt), P5 Bulgarian rest 120 → 150 APPROVED, P7 deload week APPROVED as a manual mode. Full rationale in `DECISIONS.md`; buildable specs in `QUEUE.md` as B6-02…B6-10 in dependency order. Nothing from this batch remains in the backlog sections below — the P5–P9 / P11 texts there are replaced with pointers.


Not instructions. An item becomes work only when Muse promotes it into
`QUEUE.md` / `TASK.md`. Order is value ÷ risk, highest first.
`[T1]` buildable now · `[T2]` needs a Muse design first ·
`[T3]` Khang-only proposal — the loop never builds it.

## Batch 5 — QUEUED Nov 9 (1 T2 + 19 T1, from three Muse audits + Khang's redesign direction)

Full specs in `QUEUE.md` (B5-01–B5-20); `TASK.md` has B5-01 active. Centerpiece: the lift-page redesign [T2, designed in `DESIGN.md`] answering Khang's Nov 9 screenshot critique (five stacked text layers at the top, ~150–190 px dead band at 390×844) and his user-workflows-first direction. Behind it: workflow fixes (inter-lift rest prep targeting the next lift, day-tab mid-edit backup corruption, false "New PR" on extra sets, stranded `twoTap` confirm label, overnight session-duration clamp, RIR explainer retirement, backup banner that backs up), data safety (salvage on Restore/Merge, newer-version import message, `validDate` round-trip, per-set clamps at the store boundary, sessionLog bad-date drop, salvaged-bar vs save-failure priority), a11y (44 px `.bbact`, week-strip `role`, danger-text contrast, dead menu button hidden), and the Export CSV e2e. Still blocked, not queued: off-day logging (needs Khang's P9 decision) and the `bodyweightSet` flag (schema change, Khang's call).

## Batch 4 — QUEUED Nov 9 (1 T1 + 1 T2, from Muse's Batch 3 review)

Full specs in `QUEUE.md` (B4-01–B4-02); `TASK.md` has B4-01 active. B4-01 is the B3-29 follow-up (`workoutDates` / `trainingDays` null-prototype maps). B4-02 is the corrupt-payload salvage, designed by Muse in `DESIGN.md`. Closed without queueing: the pro-review finding that `weekStatus` hardcodes 8 lifts — it already takes a `dayLens` parameter (pipeline, Nov 9 08:40) and `app.js` passes `DAY_LIFTS`; the 8 is only a fallback default. Still blocked, not queued: off-day logging (needs Khang's P9 decision) and the `bodyweightSet` flag (schema change, Khang's call per P4).

## Batch 3 — QUEUED Nov 9 (33 T1 + 2 T2, from three Muse audits)

Full specs in `QUEUE.md` (B3-01–B3-35); `TASK.md` has B3-01 active. Sources: code audit (20 items), UX audit (20 items), science research pass (L7/L8 unblocked, L6 list ready). Two findings merged (mid-rest freeze = UX #1 + code #12; pill "Start" = UX #8 + code #16). Muse spot-verified the top claims in source before queuing (future-version wipe, SW `res.ok` gaps, `jsconfig` gap, phantom sessions, merge cursor, undo-extra-set, summary PR date, restart snapshot, import size, SW register) and two key citations (Singer 2024, Goto 2019 — see `RESEARCH.md`).

Status corrections Nov 9: L9 is BUILT (verified 145/145 unit, 48/48 e2e, SW `gym-v20`) — the "proposed for Batch 3" line below is stale. Batch 2 (B1–B3) is COMPLETE + self-reviewed by OpenCode at `9556a73`. Pipeline Phases 1–5 + Pass 2 DONE (154/154 unit, 63/63 e2e, SW `gym-v35`, schema v4). The pipeline's "remaining work is Khang's" is answered by this batch (research done) and the T3 proposals below.

| B3-17 | Import has no file-size guard | T1 |
| B3-18 | No upper bound on typed/stepped load and reps | T1 |
| B3-19 | Import-merge reports no counts | T1 |

| B3-25 | "Planned +2" stays in the day summary after the workout starts | T1 |
| B3-26 | Tempo line only exists on the first lift of the day | T1 |
| B3-27 | `typecheck` never checks `restctl.js` | T1 |
| B3-28 | Tooling-guard gaps (check script, check-ids, check-assets) | T1 |
| B3-29 | Stats maps use plain `{}` keyed by user-controlled dates | T1 |
| B3-30 | Untested pure-store paths + program-id uniqueness (tests) | T1 |
| B3-31 | No automated check that the SW `CACHE` version bumps | T1 |
| B3-32 | First run has no guidance at all | T1 |
| B3-33 | No deploy version anywhere in the UI | T1 |
| B3-34 | `nextLift` never wraps to an earlier open lift | T2 (designed) |
| B3-35 | Bodyweight-resolution rule duplicated in four places | T2 (designed) |

## Next (T2 — designs in `DESIGN.md`, not queued)

### Off-day logging is misattributed (UX audit #5) [T2] — DECIDED Nov 10 → `QUEUE.md` B6-02
P9 decided ATTRIBUTE: sessions keep banking under the next training day; the build fixes the week-strip/heatmap visibility and adds the one-line "Off day — this logs as Friday" note. Decision record in `DECISIONS.md`.

### Corrupt-payload salvage [T2] — BUILT (B4-02, Nov 9; extended to Restore/Merge by B5-06)
Closed: `store.js` `salvage()` ships in B4-02 and B5-06 wires the same fallback into `importRaw`/`importMerge`. Kept here as history; not an open item.

### `bodyweightSet` flag (code audit #19) [T2, schema change] — DECIDED Nov 10 → `QUEUE.md` B6-03
Adopted: schema v4 → v5, legacy payloads derive the flag (≠ 165 ⇒ set), an explicitly set local bodyweight always wins a merge. Decision record in `DECISIONS.md`.

## Proposals (T3 — Khang only, never auto-built)

### P5 — Bulgarian split squat rest 120 s → 150 s (L8, Nov 9) — DECIDED Nov 10 → `QUEUE.md` B6-08
Approved (the only per-lift rest change the audit found; +90 s Friday, ~75 min total). Decision record in `DECISIONS.md`.

### P6 — Progression trigger: adopt the 2-for-2 rule (L7, Nov 9) — DECIDED Nov 10 → `QUEUE.md` B6-04
Adopted, evaluated at read time from the banked set arrays (last set ≥ top + 2 at target RIR in each of the last two sessions); `hitTop` stamping and the stall rule unchanged. Decision record in `DECISIONS.md`.

### P7 — Planned program-wide deload week every ~5–6 weeks (L7, Nov 9) — DECIDED Nov 10 → `QUEUE.md` B6-09 + B6-10
Approved as a MANUAL mode (menu-started, 7 days, sets × 0.6, loads × 0.9, deload sessions progression-exempt) with a once-a-week nudge line after 5+ weeks — never automatic. The companion rename (stall rule → "stall reset" in user-visible copy) is in B6-10. Decision record in `DECISIONS.md`.

### P8 — Finish a partial workout (UX audit #14) — DECIDED Nov 10 → `QUEUE.md` B6-05
Approved: Finish shows with any logged data; the summary is titled "partial, N of 8 lifts". Decision record in `DECISIONS.md`.

### P9 — Off-day logging: block or attribute? (see T2 above) — DECIDED Nov 10 → `QUEUE.md` B6-02
ATTRIBUTE (see the T2 entry above and `DECISIONS.md`).

### P10 — Overhead cable extension `partial: 1` flag: KEEP (recommended, Nov 9)
The evidence for triceps lengthened partials is the strongest in the partials literature — Goto 2019 (partial-ROM triceps extensions at long muscle lengths grew CSA +48.7% vs +28.2% full ROM, trained men, 8 weeks) and Maeo 2023 (overhead cable extensions — the exact exercise — grew the long head +28.5% vs +19.6% neutral, 12 weeks). The Nov 8 list was incomplete, not the flag wrong. `RESEARCH.md` now lists triceps; the flag stays unless Khang says otherwise. Counterweight recorded: Wolf 2025 — in trained lifters, lengthened partials tie full ROM rather than beating it; the app's conservative use (only after full-ROM failure, last set only) is exactly the "extend the last set" application, so "tie" still supports keeping it.

### P11 — L6 exercise-swap alternates — DECIDED Nov 10 → `QUEUE.md` B6-06 + B6-07
Approved: the proposed alternate list for all 24 lifts, unchanged (the verbatim strings, coaching parentheticals included, live in `QUEUE.md` B6-06 — that is now the single source). Progression model decided: log the swap under the original lift's `id` with a swap marker; swapped entries count toward volume and completion but are excluded from load suggestions, stall detection, the sparkline and PRs; no partials prompt while swapped; the swap locks once a set is logged. Decision record in `DECISIONS.md`.

## Batch 2 — QUEUED Nov 8 (B1–B3, all T1, hardening from Muse's Batch 1 review)

`QUEUE.md` holds the full specs. `TASK.md` has B1 active. B1: null / non-object
records crash merge/migrate/resetDay (reproduced by Muse on `b7d61f0`).
B2: nested `__proto__` inside a record survives sanitize (inert today).
B3: `node --test test/` fails on Node 24 — fix the test script to the glob.

## Batch 1 — COMPLETE Nov 8 (L1–L5, all T1, verified by Muse at `b7d61f0`)

`QUEUE.md` holds the full specs (history — do not re-run). L1 rest pure slice,
L2 partials audit, L3 sessionDrift, L4 a11y pass, L5 security audit.
Verified: 96/96 unit, typecheck clean, 41/41 e2e, Pages live `gym-v11`.

### L1 — Rest decisions into rest.js (pure slice) [T1] — ACTIVE
Revised in re-check: full controller extraction is T2 (new item
L9 below), so this batch takes the safe pure slice only — the
remaining pure decisions (`restMsg`, `goLabel`, `prepVisible`)
into `rest.js` + tests, `restCtx` stays in `app.js`.

### L2 — Audit the lengthened-partials prompt [T1]
Re-check: timing looks correct in source (`app.js:967` — fires
only on lift completion with last RIR ≤1); this item verifies it
with e2e. Open question found: Sun overhead cable extension is
flagged `partial: 1` but is NOT in the `RESEARCH.md` list —
report it, do not change the flag.

### L3 — Day-time model vs real sessions [T1, audit]
Re-check: Pass 4 `sessionLog` (`day` + `durationSec` +
`status`) makes this measurable at last — add pure
`Stats.sessionDrift`, test with fixtures, report. Expect
"insufficient data" (sessions are brand new; no phone data
reaches this session). No constants change, no UI change.

### L4 — Accessibility pass [T1]
Re-check: concrete sub-44px controls found in Pass 4 CSS —
`.mini` 44×36, `.resetlift` 30px, `.applybtn` 30px (28px
short-phone), `.bbdismiss` 26×26, short-phone steppers 40px,
peek-strip buttons 40px. Rest arrows already out of tab order
(`.rnav{display:none}` while resting) — verify.

### L5 — Security audit: import + service worker [T1]
Re-check: Pass 4 extended sanitization to sessions; existing
hostile coverage is one test. Probes: `__proto__` /
`constructor` keys via merge, `1e999` / `Infinity` numbers,
non-array sets, hostile session lifts. Plus SW discipline
(`gym-v7`) and the threat-model paragraph in `PLAN.md`.

## Next (T2 — Muse designs first)

### L6 — Exercise swap map [T2]
Curated alternates per lift (e.g. what replaces Smith squat if the
machine is taken). Needs a curated map in `program.js` and a
progression model for swapped lifts — and Khang's sign-off on the
alternate list, since it touches program data. DESIGN first.

### L7 — Progression model review [T2]
Double progression (top reps at target RIR → +step) + 3-missed-top
→ ~10% deload. Review against the literature in `RESEARCH.md`
(2-for-2 rule, RIR accuracy, deload size/frequency). Outcome is a
proposal to Khang, not a silent model change.

### L8 — Rest-interval audit [T2]
App rests are 90/120/150/180 s. Literature (to be cited in
`RESEARCH.md`) generally favours ~2–3 min for compounds, ~1–2 min
for isolations. Audit each lift's rest against that, propose
changes — T3 for the actual numbers.

### L9 — Full rest-controller extraction [T2] — DESIGNED Nov 8
Design is in `DESIGN.md` ("L9 design"): new `restctl.js`, controller owns
`rest` + `restCtx` + interval + finish-arming, returns `{state, view,
effects}`; `app.js` stays the DOM shell and performs effects (beep /
vibrate / notify / advance / finish). Pure `machine.js` / `rest.js` untouched.
BUILT Nov 9 (verified 145/145 unit, 48/48 e2e, SW `gym-v20`) — see `TASK.md`. Next T2 designs, in order: L6 (alternate list now proposed as P11, needs Khang's approval first), then L7/L8 (research done Nov 9; proposals P5–P7, program numbers are T3).

## Proposals (T3 — Khang only, never auto-built)

### P1 — Rest / load / rep number changes in `program.js`
Any change to a lift's rest, load, reps, or sets. Comes from L7/L8
research as a concrete proposal with evidence. Khang approves per
lift or declines.

### P2 — Split / days change
E.g. a 4th day, or Wed/Fri/Sun instead of Fri/Sat/Sun. Proposal
only, with the time-budget math (75–90 min/day target).

### P3 — New features
Anything not in the current scope (e.g. new views, new tracking).
Khang decides; the loop does not add fluff.

### P4 — Count caps in `store.js` (set Nov 9, Phase 5)
`DONE_MAX` / `SETS_MAX` = 12, `ACC_SEC_MAX` = 8 h, `BODYWEIGHT_MAX` = 300 kg,
and `getLift` now backfills legacy placeholder rows only up to the lift's
scheduled `e.s`. These are code constants, not program data, but they decide
what an imported backup is allowed to contain. If a lift ever goes above 12
scheduled sets, or a session is legitimately longer than 8 h, the cap has to
be raised — that is a Khang call, not a loop change.

## Deferred / non-goals (do not re-propose without new evidence)

- Cloud backend / accounts, Apple Watch / Health, full ESM migration,
  IndexedDB. Reasoning in `DESIGN.md`.
- Exercise swap was deferred in Pass 2 for exactly the reasons in L6
  — it is T2 now, not forgotten.

## Pro review findings — Nov 9, 05:55 CT (one sparse run; plan in `QUEUE.md` Batch 3)

| # | Sev | Finding | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | MED | `package.json` `check` never runs `node --check rest.js` (loaded by `index.html:209`, cached in `sw.js:9`) — a syntax error there ships past the fast gate | queued as **B4** [T1] |
| 2 | LOW | `stats.js:48` `setsLogged` is exported and unit-tested but never called by the app (`app.js:393` uses `setsRecorded`) | leave — deliberate exported surface, do not delete |
| 3 | LOW | `app.js:9` + `timer.js:23` `sessionElapsed` alias/function unused in production (`Gym.sessionElapsedSec` is the real clock) | leave — same reason |
| 4 | LOW | `stats.js:296` `weekStatus` hardcodes `n >= 8` lifts as "done" — latent coupling to read-only program data | T1 candidate after L9 (pass the day's lift count in, default 8) |
| 5 | LOW | `sw.js` `CACHE` must be `gym-v20` + `restctl.js` in ASSETS or `check-assets` fails | enforced by the in-flight L9 build |

**Declined for now (Khang only):** raising `DONE_MAX`/`SETS_MAX`/`ACC_SEC_MAX`/
`BODYWEIGHT_MAX` (P4); deleting the exported-but-unread symbols above; any
`program.js` number change (P1/P2). The reviewer's top pick is L8, with B4 as
the only immediately buildable T1.
